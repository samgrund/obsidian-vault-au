From wikipedia:
> In nuclear physics, the astrophysical S-factor $S(E)$ is a rescaling of a nuclear reaction's total cross section to account for Coloumb repulsion between the charged reactants. It determines the rates of nuclear fusion reactions that occur in the cores of stars.

The Sommerfeld parameter
$$
\eta = \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \hbar v}
$$
captures the effect of long range electromagnetic interactions on the reaction.

From ChatGPT:
> Essentially all the energy dependence is captured in the S-factor. Because astrophysical energies are so low compared to laboratory experiments, it is often difficult to examine the cross sections. Instead one can examine the S-factor at higher energies and extrapolate down to lower energies.
> The S-factor is often determined experimentally at higher energies, where direct measurements are more feasible. Experimental techniques and facilities are typically better suited for studying nuclear reactions at higher energies compared to the very low energies relevant for astrophysical processes.

>Once the S-factor is measured or calculated at higher energies, it can be used to extrapolate the behavior of the reaction down to the low energies encountered in astrophysical environments. This extrapolation is based on the assumption that the S-factor remains relatively constant as the energy decreases, which is generally valid for nuclear reactions involving light atomic nuclei.

(Lets pray to the AI gods that this is correct)

From Sciencedirect (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375947419300545#:~:text=The%20astrophysical%20S%2Dfactor%20which,owing%20to%20the%20exponential%20factor.):
>The astrophysical S-factor which is related to cross section  is, however, a slowly varying function and is much less prone to extrapolation errors down to low energies of astrophysical interest than cross section which has sharp energy dependence owing to the exponential factor.



This is of course only correct for non-resonant interactions.
