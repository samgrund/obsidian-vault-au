Gamow window is the range of energies where nuclear reactions occur in stars. It is essentially the overlap between the high temperature end of the maxwell boltzmann distribution and the reaction cross section. To see this intuitively, see the figures below.
It is generally discussed in the notes chapter 5, but here are some key takeaways:
- We are essentially discussing a term like $$\langle \sigma v\rangle$$
- High temperatures (~$10^7$K)
- Identical particles
- This is an overall image, resonances in the Gamow window may dominate the reaction.
- Can be described by some peak energy/temperature (effective burning temperature) and width like a gaussian.
- The formulae for the center point energy and width are given by the product of the individual charges, mean molecular mass and this $T_6$ factor (to some power, see the notes for exact formula - this is just for intuition).
