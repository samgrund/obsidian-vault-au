The liquid drop model is a model in which nuclei are thought to behave similarly to liquids. The model accounts for difference in forces acting on constituent particles on the surface than the interior of the drop, which is analogous to considering surface tension.

- Nuclei seem to have constant density
- Spherical
- Probably other assumptions, but the basic framework is considering which terms might contribute to the stability and energy of a liquid drop composed of nucleons.

It is from the liquid drop model that the [[Semiempirical mass formula]] originates.
