The optical model is only mentioned in section 20.9 in Zelevinsky.

We interpret the sharp resonances as *quasistationary many-body states*

From article (https://www.oecd-nea.org/science/om200/hodgson.pdf): 
>The interaction of a nucleon with a nucleus is inherently complicated, and the optical model represents it by a phenomenological potential of very simple form, with parameters that are adjusted to t the experimental data. This potential has an imaginary part that takes into account the absorption of the reaction flux from the elastic channel to the non-elastic reaction channels. This is analogous to the scattering and absorption of light by a medium of complex refractive index, which is why it is called the optical model.

From ChatGPT:
- Model that provides a simplified representation of the interaction between the incident particle and the target nucleus
- Assumes a nucleus a spherically symmetric potential well
- Potential split into real and imaginary part.
	- Real part represents the average effect of the attractive nuclear force
	- Imaginary part accounts for loss of flux or probability due to processes such as absorption or inelastic scattering
- This corresponds to the interaction of light in a medium of complex refractive index as also stated by the article.

Nuclear interactions are extremely complex as there are both strong and short range components that depend on many variable, e.g. relative distance, spins, isospin etc.

It is a phenomenological approach. The real and imaginary components of the interaction can be obtained experimentally.

In terms of intuition, one can think of the optical model as a way to account for the fact that the scattering process involves not only elastic scattering (where the incident particle changes direction but retains its energy) but also inelastic scattering or absorption (where the incident particle can be absorbed or excite the target nucleus to a higher energy state). By including the imaginary potential in the optical model, the framework can effectively describe the loss of flux or probability associated with these processes.
