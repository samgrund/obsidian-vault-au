**s-process (s for slow)**:
Neutron capture within giant stars. This does not giver higher $Z$ but by $\beta$ decay these neutrons can turn into protons.
- Elements up to Bismuth

**r-process (r for rapid)**:
- Accounts for the remaining 50% of heavy nuclei
- Happens in the last about 1 second during the core collapse and rebound of a type II supernova.
- Exceptionally high neutron flux meaning much more neutron capture possible before beta decay can occur.

- As the r-process happens in supernovae, this mechanism is likely responsible for much of the enrichment of the interstellar medium as material is blown away from the star.
