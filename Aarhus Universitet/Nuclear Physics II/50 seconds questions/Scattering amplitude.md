#scattering 
When considering quantum mechanical particles scattered by some potential, the asymptotic outgoing wave can be written as
$$
\psi(r) = e^{ikz} + f(\theta)\frac{e^{ikr}}{r},
$$
where $f(\theta)$ is the scattering amplitude (here only described by one coordinate because of the fact that there is very likely to be axial symmetry for the problem).

The general idea is that an incoming pane wave interacts with the potential and the result is some part of the wave continuing (i.e. the first term in the expression) and that there is some radially outgoing spherical wave that leaves the scatterer, i.e. the second term. The (complex I guess as there may be some phase) scattering amplitude then holds the information of the strength of the scattering process and other intricacies.

It is an important quantity, partly because it gives a theoretical framework to calculate the scattering strength, and partly because it is closely related to the cross-section:
$$
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = |f(\theta))|^2.
$$
