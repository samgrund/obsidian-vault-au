This relates to both [[Scattering amplitude]] and [[Phase shifts]]

We are considering "low energy", i.e. $kR < 1$ where $R$ is the force range. For n-p scattering this is energies of ~5 MeV in CM frame, ~10MeV in proton rest frame.

As we saw in [[Phase shifts]], only $\ell=0$ can have a significant phase shift $\delta_\ell$. Actually the $\ell=1$ p-wave scattering process is further suppressed by parity selection rules, so it is very good to only consider s-waves for n-p interactions in this energy regime.![[Pasted image 20230609152250.png]]
