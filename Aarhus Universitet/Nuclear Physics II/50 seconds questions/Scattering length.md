#scattering 
This relates to both [[Scattering amplitude]] and [[Phase shifts]]

We are considering "low energy", i.e. $kR < 1$ where $R$ is the force range. For n-p scattering this is energies of ~5 MeV in CM frame, ~10MeV in proton rest frame.

Solutions show that the s-wave phase shift as $k \rightarrow 0$ is proportional to $k$. The coefficient of proportionality is the scattering length

$$
\lim_{k\rightarrow 0}\frac{\delta(k)}{k} = -a
$$
Actually the limit of the [[Scattering amplitude]] at low energies is also the scattering length:
$$
\lim_{k\rightarrow0}f = -a
$$
The limit of the cross section in this limit is
$$
\lim_{k\rightarrow 0} \sigma = 4\pi a^2
$$
For an impenetrable wall, the scattering length matches with the radius R of the wall. But more generally it can differ. In this sense the scattering length is a generalised wall radius for non-impenetrable walls at very low energies.

As we saw in [[Phase shifts]], only $\ell=0$ can have a significant phase shift $\delta_\ell$. Actually the $\ell=1$ p-wave scattering process is further suppressed by parity selection rules, so it is very good to only consider s-waves for n-p interactions in this energy regime.![[Pasted image 20230609152250.png]]
