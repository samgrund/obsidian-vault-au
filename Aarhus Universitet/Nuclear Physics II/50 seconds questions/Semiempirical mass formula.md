Formula used to approximate mass of an atomic nucleus from $Z$ and $N$. It is based on the [[Liquid drop model]]. The formula is (5.2 from Zelevinsky):
$$
B(A,Z) = b_vA - b_s A^{2/3}-b_{symm}\frac{(N-Z)^2}{2A}-b_c\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}} + b_p \left[(-1)^N + (-1)^Z\right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{A}}
$$
As such there are **5** terms:
- Volume term : When more nuclei are squished together, each has more contact and thus interacts more leading to added energy.
- Surface term : Corrects the volume term in the sense that it tries to account for the surface nucleons that do not have as many nearby nucleons.
- Symmetry term : Symmetric N,Z distributions are favoured because of the pauli exclusion principle
- Coulomb (or electrostatic) term : Repulsive force between protons
- Pairing term : Paired nucleons are more stable because of spin coupling / pairing.
Here is a neat illustration from wikipedia that kind of shows what they correspond to physically:

The model can be fit to experimental data and you get a reasonable model. It is of course a pretty continuous model and thus only gives an overall picture:

and in reality there are effects that cannot be explained by the model:
