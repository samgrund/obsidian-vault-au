**Nilsson model** is a model that treats the atomic nucleus as a deformed sphere.

Experimental results were found that showed rotational bands in nuclei, which is quantum mechanically forbidden in the case of completely spherical nuclei.

The model is essentially a nuclear shell model using a harmonic oscillator potential that is in general anisotropical in the 3 principal axis.

Superdeformed states have been observed with a deformation parameter $\deltaÂ \approx 0.5$, i.e. a 2-to-1 axis ratio!

As deformation leads to shifts in energy levels, the "traditional" shell picture is broken for higher deformations. This effect is most prominent for larger nuclei, see for example graphs grabbed from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilsson_model#:~:text=The%20Nilsson%20model%20is%20a,energies%20as%20in%20rotating%20molecules.

This of course also leads to the idea that magic numbers are not, in general, so magic.

Because of the anisotropy, aka non-spherical nature, actually the  angular momentum $J$ is no longer a good quantum number. The potential is not spherically symmetric and thus single particle states are not angular momentum eigenstates. This probably has some interesting implications as well for the transition rules etc of these deformed states.
