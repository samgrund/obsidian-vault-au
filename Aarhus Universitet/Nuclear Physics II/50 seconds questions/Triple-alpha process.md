Main sequence stars burn hydrogen by the [[proton-proton chain]] and [[carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle]]. Once helium burning begins it is carried out by the **triple-alpha process**. In this process, three alpha particles react to form carbon 12. This does not happen all at once though, first two alpha particles form beryllium 8 (note that this reaction can go both ways!). This beryllium product then fuses with another helium 4 and finally creates carbon 12.

**Some notes:**
- Helium accumulates in stellar cores as a result of PP chain and CNO cycle
- Nuclear fusion of alpha particles create highly unstable Be8
- Once a star runs of out hydrogen to fuse it stats to contract and heat up.
- If the central temperature rises to ~$10^8K$, alpha particles can fuse fast enough to get past the Be8 barrier.
- At this point significant amounts of stable carbon-12 can be produced.
- The net energy release of the process is around 7.275 MeV.
- This process was not very efficient at the conditions of the Big Bang and thus there is no significant amount of primordial carbon present in the universe.
