## The oral exam, Nuclear Physics 2023

The oral exam will take place June 20. The compulsory exercises must be handed in by May 16, if not approved by May 24 you will not be allowed for the oral exam.  
You have one day of preparation time and can start the exam with a 10 minutes prepared presentation. The oral exam will stay within your exam question typically for some more minutes, but will then typically move to other subjects ("highlights" of the curriculum as indicated by the summary points). Please note that most exam subjects are quite broad: you will not be able to cover all aspects in your presentation, but should be prepared to discuss all of them.  
**The exam questions:**

1. Isospin
2. Nucleon-nucleon forces
3. Collective degrees of freedom
4. Mean field models
5. The interacting shell model and pairing
6. Nuclear decays
7. Nuclear reactions (at low energy)
8. Heavy ion reactions and phases of nuclear matter
9. Nuclear astrophysics
