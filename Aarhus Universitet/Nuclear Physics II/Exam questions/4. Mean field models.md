The smooth behaviour of binding energies according to [[Liquid drop model]] and thus the [[Semiempirical mass formula]] cannot explain energy modulations around the magic numbers.

Existence of single particle shells is well known from atomic systems. Simplest approach for using this idea is the independent particle shell model. This is nothing but a Femri gas model for *realistic nuclear potentials* taken as a mean field.

In nuclear physics we see that certain numbers of protons and neutrons lead to especially stable nuclear systems. These numbers for nuclei among the valley of stability are
$$
2, 8, 20, 50, 82, 126.
$$
(They are the same for protons and neutrons because the shape of the mean field is nearly the same for the two species)
Magic numbers correspond to a number of particles for a closed major shell (large energy gap between neighbouring shells). There are also subshell spacings but these are not as pronounced.

Can be examined by considering the separation energy, i.e. the energy difference between system with a closed shell and one with one extra nucleon. Often time one looks at the two-nucleon separation energy instead so as to minimize the effect of pairing.

Nuclei with valence nucleons will be more susceptible to deformation, which makes sense I guess.

## 8.5 Harmonic Oscillator Potential
Simplest analytically solvable model of the mean nuclear field: *Isotropic harmonic oscillator* potential. It is somewhat unrealistic:
- Excessive symmetry $\rightarrow$ Full degeneracy inside a major shell
- Absence of continuum spectrum as the potential energy goes to infinity as large distances.
Isotropic cartesian oscillator leads to degeneracy in all 3 principle axes:
$$
\ket{n_x,n_y,n_z}
$$
$$
n_x + n_y + n_z = N
$$
All combinations of partial quantum numbers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ with the same sum as above have the same energy and form the $N$th major shell.

## 8.6 Orbital momentum representation
Many potentials are centrally symmetric and thus the orbital angular momentum is a good quantum number. 

## 8.8 Spin-orbit coupling
In a nucleus with one nucleon on top of the magic core, spin-spin and [[Tensor forces]] between the nucleon and core nucleons do not contribute to the single particle energy because in the core all spins are compensated so that the net result of such interactions averages to zero. However **not** the case for spin-orbit forces.

This interaction is relativistic in the sense that it is originated by the interaction of the electron spin magnetic moment with the magnetic field seen by the electron in an electrostatic field of the nucleus.

The result is a splitting of the energy levels depending on the relative orientation of the angular and spin moments.
